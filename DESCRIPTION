Description: The package contains a collection of functions for left-censored missing data imputation. Left-censoring is a special case of missing not at random (MNAR)  mechanism that generates non-responses in proteomics experiments. The package also contains functions to artificially generate peptide/protein expression data (log-transformed) as random draws from a multivariate Gaussian distribution as well as a function to generate missing data (both randomly and non-randomly). For comparison reasons, the package also contains several wrapper functions for the imputation of non-responses that are missing at random.
